# Development Workflow

> This file extends [git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) with the full feature development
> process that happens before git operations.

The Feature Implementation Workflow describes the development pipeline: research, planning,
TDD, code review, and then committing to git. Apply it proportionally — small fixes and
config tweaks don't need the full pipeline.

## Feature Implementation Workflow

0. **Research & Reuse** _(before any substantial new implementation)_
   - **GitHub code search first:** Run `gh search repos` and `gh search code` to find existing implementations, templates, and patterns before writing anything new.
   - **Library docs second:** Use Context7 or primary vendor docs to confirm API behavior, package usage, and version-specific details before implementing.
   - **Exa only when the first two are insufficient:** Use Exa for broader web research or discovery after GitHub search and primary docs.
   - **Check package registries:** Search npm, PyPI, crates.io, and other registries before writing utility code. Prefer battle-tested libraries over hand-rolled solutions.
   - **Search for adaptable implementations:** Look for open-source projects that solve 80%+ of the problem and can be forked, ported, or wrapped.
   - Prefer adopting or porting a proven approach over writing net-new code when it meets the requirement.

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **Plan Mode** or the built-in **Plan** agent to create an implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Keep coverage healthy on projects that track it

3. **Code Review**
   - Run `/code-review` (or `coderabbit:code-review`) after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - See [git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) for commit message format and PR process

5. **Pre-Review Checks**
   - Verify all automated checks (CI/CD) are passing
   - Resolve any merge conflicts
   - Ensure branch is up to date with target branch
   - Only request review after these checks pass
